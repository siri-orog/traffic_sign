# Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN

![Traffic Sign Recognition](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Traffic%20Sign%20Recognition-blue)

This project implements a **Traffic Sign Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** in Python. The system can classify traffic signs from images and is trained on a publicly available dataset.

## Introduction

Traffic Sign Recognition is an essential component of **autonomous vehicles** and **driver-assist systems**. This project uses a CNN-based model to classify traffic signs from images with high accuracy.

---

## Features

* Recognizes multiple traffic sign categories.
* Trains CNN on the dataset for traffic sign classification.
* Predicts traffic signs on new images.
* Easy-to-use Python scripts for training and prediction.

---

## Dataset

This project uses the **[German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html)** dataset.

* Number of classes: 43
* Training images: ~39,000
* Test images: ~12,600

You can download the dataset and organize it in the following structure:

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── 0/
│   ├── 1/
│   └── ...
└── test/
    └── images/
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/traffic-sign-recognition.git
cd traffic-sign-recognition
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

```bash
python src/train.py --data_dir data/train --model_dir models
```

**Arguments:**

* `--data_dir`: Path to training dataset
* `--model_dir`: Directory to save the trained model

---

### Predicting on a New Image

```bash
python src/predict.py --model models/traffic_sign_final.h5 --image "data/new_sign.png"
```

**Arguments:**

* `--model`: Path to the trained model
* `--image`: Path to the input image for prediction

---

## Results

After training, the model achieves **~98% accuracy** on the test set.
